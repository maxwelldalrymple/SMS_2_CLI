# SMS to Terminal Algorithm

This algorithm allows you to text CLI (Command Line Interface) commands to your computer and have the output sent back as a text message to your phone. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

1) Remotely managing servers or other computing resources
2) Running commands on a computer that is not easily accessible
3) Automating tasks via text message

## Requirements
To build and use this algorithm, you'll need:

1) A computer running a Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.) with the ability to receive SMS messages
2) A Twilio account and a phone number to send and receive text messages
3) Python 3 installed on your computer

## Setting up Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that allows you to send and receive text messages. To use Twilio, you'll need to sign up for an account and purchase a phone number.

1) Go to Twilio and sign up for an account.
2) Once you've signed up, go to the Console and create a new project.
3) In the project dashboard, click on "Get a number" to purchase a new phone number.
4) Follow the steps to purchase a phone number.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building an SMS to terminal algorithm can be a useful tool for remotely managing servers or other computing resources, running commands on a computer that is not easily accessible, and automating tasks via text message. By using Twilio's API and Python, it's possible to set up a system that receives text messages, interprets them as CLI commands, runs them on your computer, and sends the output back to your phone. While this may require some initial setup and configuration, it can ultimately save time and effort by allowing you to perform tasks without being physically present at your compu
